\\ check-audit-post-trim.gp --- E024: the two numerical claims that the
\\ post-trim consistency pass of paper.tex depends on.
\\
\\ Context.  The long remarks on q >= 5 (rem:abc, rem:powerful, rem:q5) and the
\\ subsection on the sporadic b=3 (subsec:b3) were removed from paper.tex and
\\ deferred to a sequel.  Two statements in the trimmed text still rest on
\\ computation, and both are checked here.
\\
\\ (A) thm:idx is an EQUIVALENCE, not merely an implication.
\\     For a prime p with p !| b,
\\         p | [O_{K_b} : Z[theta]]   <=>   b^3 = 4  (mod p^2).
\\     The statement had been weakened to "implies" while the Introduction
\\     (Theorem B) still claims "such p are exactly the primes p !| b dividing
\\     [O_K:Z[theta]], and they are characterized by b^3 = 4 mod p^2", and while
\\     the proof in fact establishes the equivalence.  This run confirms the
\\     equivalence numerically before it is restored in the text.
\\     Method: a = |sqrt(disc(f_b)/D_K)| from nfinit, compared prime by prime
\\     with the congruence.  Note both sides fail for p = 2,3 when p !| b, which
\\     is the p in {2,3} half of the proof.
\\
\\ (B) The exponents behind Remark 5.7 of paper.tex.
\\     Under (star), "not fundamental <=> square" (thm:starq), so for |b| <= 3000
\\     the b with eta_b not fundamental are exactly the square-exceptions of
\\     thm:closed lying in that range, together with the four b where (star)
\\     fails (b = -75,-3,3,9; the first three are square-exceptions anyway).
\\     Writing eta_b = eta_0^n with eta_0 the fundamental unit, the prime
\\     divisors of n are exactly the exponents q that occur.  Remark 5.7 claims
\\     q = 2 (infinitely often), q = 3 only at b = 9, q = 13 at b = 3, and no
\\     q >= 17 for |b| <= 3000; this run produces the table of n.
\\
\\ NB: `eta` is a PARI built-in (Dedekind eta), so the unit is called u1 below.
\\
\\ Usage:  gp -q check-audit-post-trim.gp        (a few minutes)
